I WANT TO BE ABLE TO:

* model pairwise relations between objects
* speak about graph data
* derive data thru a syntax
** simple
** intuitive

graph part entity
network Graph


PARTS

* blob (vertices, nodes, points)
** init with one id

* link (edges, arcs, lines)
** init with two ids (nodes) // links inherently have nodes


Graph class
* getSet() ask for whole set




WISH (things i want to derive)

* calc all distances from a point
* ask node for distance to another node

add nodes -- derive links?
add links -- derive node for sure



UTILS

hashBy() take set and make object by outing a key property
listBy() util order parts (of type) by property?
