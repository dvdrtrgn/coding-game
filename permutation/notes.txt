When the order does matter it is a Permutation.
When the order doesn't matter, it is a Combination.

// n=choices / r=places

TWO PERMUTATION TYPES:

Repetition: 
  "a combination lock (#, #, #)"
  n ^ r 

No Repetition: 
  "the first three people in a race (1st, 2nd, 3rd)"
  n! / (n - r)!
  P(n,r)

TWO COMBINATION TYPES:

No Repetition:  
  "lottery numbers (2,14,15,27,30,33)"
  n! / r!(n-r)! ... C(n,r)

Repetition: 
  "coins in your pocket (5,5,10,5,10)"
  (n+r-1)! / r!(n-r)! ... C(n+r-1,r)
